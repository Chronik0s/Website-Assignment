        <h3>3. rm8</h3>
        <p>rm8 sits strongly in the #3 position of Alberta's rankings. Not only is he ranked #7 out of all Ike players
            in the world, he also carries the most tournament experience ever recorded
            in super smash bros ultimate. Due to the incredible amount of tournaments he has attended, his win rate does
            not show up due to immense overload of data. </p>

        <h3>4. Marf</h3>
        <p>Marf is one of the most outstanding players from a character choice perspective. He places solidly in the top
            10 Zelda players in the world, and 1106th for global results.
            He has wins on some of Canada's best, including Toasted, Silver, rm8, Exodia (A retired player from Alberta,

        <h3>5. Noot</h3>
        <p>Noot is an edmonton player who uses the jolly and unexpected King Dedede. His results show a 10% win increase
            since 2021, but perhaps the most impressive
            win under his belt is against the #2 player in the world, Sparg0. At Alberta Esports Expo 2023, he brought
            BC's #2 player: Machu to one of the most
            jaw-dropping game 5 sets before being eliminated in top 5. World-wide, he has achieved rank 2668 and looks
            towards raising that rank in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="feature2">Biggest Events of the Year</h2>
        <h3>Alberta Esports Expo</h3>
        <p>On February 18-19 of 2023, Edmonton held one of the biggest Esports events in Alberta since the pandemic. It
            saw over 500 entrants as well as over 2500 spectators! Artists and competitors
            alike saw a first in a long time, a live audience. The event was held at the Edmonton Expo Centre and was a
            huge success. There were many games played at the event, but the biggest one was
            Super Smash Bros Ultimate. The live stream reached a peak of 130 viewers and reached 2000 people total
            overall.

        <h3>Lacombe Dome Anarchy Splatfest</h3>
        <p>Lacombe, a city of around 10k citizens ran a smash ultimate tournament over the final weekend of August. The
            event saw a total of 136 competitors and had a large stack of events related to
            smash bros. The first day ran with little to no issues, meanwhile the second day had a 2 hour late startup
            due to the venue not being unlocked at the designated time.
            This slight hiccup lead to an iconic moment of Alberta in 2023: Van Doubles. As the name states, some
            matches of the doubles bracket ended up being played in a van.

        <h2 class="feature2">Upcoming Players</h2>
        <h3>NootNoot</h3>
        <p>NootNoot (Ethan) is a smash ultimate player from Lethbridge. He is ranked at number 6856 in the world
            with Bowser. Outside of some very strong wins in Lethbridge and Medicine Hat,
            he has had much success outside of Alberta. He is a very strong player and is looking to improve his
            results in the future. At GOML 2023, he made 129th place out of over 600 entrants.
            This result gave him the best results in Alberta out of all that attended.

        <h3>StirFryTy</h3>
        <p>StirFryTy is a force to be reckoned with. in 2022, Edmonton held what is known as the Alberta Arcadian. This event banned top players on the ranking from entering, giving new players a shot at
            victory. StirFryTy was one of the players who entered and he ended up winning the event without dropping a set. This is then amplified by his character choice: Little Mac. Considered one of the 
            hardest characters to play due to his lack of options in game. So winning, despite harsh character restrictions, is one of the biggest feats in Alberta smash history. He is ranked 2772 world-wide
            at this point in time.

        <h3>JeebJeeb</h3>
        <p> JeebJeeb is a younger, passionate player in the AB smash community. Already Ranked at #5787 in the world with Lucas, he has plenty of potential. With wins on rm8, Toasted and even Silver, 
            he is a player to watch out for in the future. He has a 66% win rate, and is known for being "too wholesome" in the community. He is a very kind and respectful player, and is a great addition to the community.
            to the scene. There are stories of him winning Edmonton events and telling the tournament organizers to keep the money.
