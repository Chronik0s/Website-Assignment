        <h2>Top Players</h2>
        <h3>1. Silver</h3>
        <p>Silver has been in the AB smash bros scene for many years. Years of dedicated practice lead for him to take
            the top position on the AB Smash player rankings. At this point in time, Silver
            is ranked #22 world-wide with Palutena, #5 world-wide with Wii-Fit Trainer, and #5 world-wide with Pit. His
            current win-rate is 76%. Silver has many wins on players both in and out of
            region. One of his most prominent wins is against one of BC's best: Big D, who used Ice Climbers to acscend
            to #127 world-wide!</p>
        <h3>2. Toasted</h3>
        <p>Toasted is currently ranked at number 2 in Alberta. World-wide, he has the currently ranked #41 Mr. Game and
            Watch. One of his best results was 17/741 at Coinbox #23. His current win-rate
            is 65%. </p>
        <h3>3. rm8</h3>
        <p>rm8 sits strongly in the #3 position of Alberta's rankings. Not only is he ranked #7 out of all Ike players
            in the world, he also carries the most tournament experience ever recorded
            in super smash bros ultimate. Due to the incredible amount of tournaments he has attended, his win rate does
            not show up due to immense overload of data. </p>
        <h3>4. Marf</h3>
        <p>Marf is one of the most outstanding players from a character choice perspective. He places solidly in the top
            10 Zelda players in the world, and 1106th for global results.
            He has wins on some of Canada's best, including Toasted, Silver, rm8, Exodia (A retired player from Alberta,
            who used to be the top player for years), and many more.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Noot</h3>
        <p>Noot is an edmonton player who uses the jolly and unexpected King Dedede. His results show a 10% win increase
            since 2021, but perhaps the most impressive
            win under his belt is against the #2 player in the world, Sparg0. At Alberta Esports Expo 2023, he brought
            BC's #2 player: Machu to one of the most
            jaw-dropping game 5 sets before being eliminated in top 5. World-wide, he has achieved rank 2668 and looks
            towards raising that rank in the future.</p>

        <h2>Biggest Events of the Year</h2>
        <h3>Alberta Esports Expo</h3>
        <p>On February 18-19 of 2023, Edmonton held one of the biggest Esports events in Alberta since the pandemic. It
            saw over 500 entrants as well as over 2500 spectators! Artists and competitors
            alike saw a first in a long time, a live audience. The event was held at the Edmonton Expo Centre and was a
            huge success. There were many games played at the event, but the biggest one was
            Super Smash Bros Ultimate. The live stream reached a peak of 130 viewers and reached 2000 people total
            overall.
        </p>
        <h3>Lacombe Dome Anarchy Splatfest</h3>
        <p>Lacombe, a city of around 10k citizens ran a smash ultimate tournament over the final weekend of August. The
            event saw a total of 136 competitors and had a large stack of events related to
            smash bros. The first day ran with little to no issues, meanwhile the second day had a 2 hour late startup
            due to the venue not being unlocked at the designated time.
            This slight hiccup lead to an iconic moment of Alberta in 2023: Van Doubles. As the name states, some
            matches of the doubles bracket ended up being played in a van.
